# Kotlin coding conventions

This is the detailed reference for **how to write Kotlin** in this repository. For **how the repo
operates** (build, commands, tooling pipeline, generated README, versions, CI, git hooks, PR
mechanics), see [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md). The two don't duplicate each other.

## How to use this reference

1. **Tooling enforces the mechanics; this file covers the judgment.** Formatting, indentation,
   import ordering, expression bodies, naming, modifier order, and trailing commas are checked
   automatically by `ktlint`, `detekt`, `diktat`, and `spotless`. Don't hand-optimize them from
   memory — run `./gradlew spotlessApply` and `make check` and let the tools decide (see
   [`commands.md`](commands.md)). What follows focuses on the decisions the linters *can't* make
   for you.
2. **When unsure, mirror the canonical example files.** The most reliable pattern in this repo is
   to write code like the existing examples:
   - [`DataProcessor.kt`](../../core/src/main/kotlin/dev/shtanko/template/core/DataProcessor.kt) —
     coroutines, dispatcher injection, `Flow`, error handling.
   - [`Calculator.kt`](../../core/src/main/kotlin/dev/shtanko/template/core/Calculator.kt) —
     expression bodies, KDoc.
   - [`DataProcessorTest.kt`](../../core/src/test/kotlin/dev/shtanko/template/core/DataProcessorTest.kt)
     & [`ExampleTest.kt`](../../core/src/test/kotlin/dev/shtanko/template/core/ExampleTest.kt) — the
     testing style (JUnit 5, coroutine tests, Turbine); see [`testing.md`](testing.md).
3. **For a deep procedure, load the matching skill instead of re-deriving it.** Branching,
   coroutine scope ownership, `Flow` primitive choice, function ownership, and value-class-vs-data-
   class decisions each have a dedicated, step-by-step skill under
   [`../skills/`](../skills/) — see the map in [`../README.md`](../README.md).

## Project context that affects code

- **JVM-only Kotlin template**, Gradle (Kotlin DSL), targeting JVM 17+ (CI builds on 17 and 21).
  There is **no Android** here — ignore Android-only APIs (`viewModelScope`, `lifecycleScope`,
  `Context`, `View`, etc.) and Compose-only APIs. The project is split into `app` and `core`
  modules sharing settings via the `template.kotlin-library` convention plugin in `buildSrc`.
- **Compiler is Kotlin 2.4.0, but the language level is pinned to 2.2.** The
  `template.kotlin-library` convention plugin sets `apiVersion`/`languageVersion` to `KOTLIN_2_2`
  for every module. Do **not** use language features newer than 2.2 even though a 2.4 compiler is
  running.
- **Coroutines are first-class.** The `kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8` and (in tests)
  `kotlinx-coroutines-test` + Turbine dependencies are wired in — see `DataProcessor.kt` for the
  intended style, and load
  [`kotlin-coroutines-structured-concurrency`](../skills/kotlin-coroutines-structured-concurrency/SKILL.md)
  before reviewing or writing non-trivial coroutine code.

## Enforced by tooling (don't sweat these by hand)

Running `make check` / `./gradlew spotlessApply` covers all of the following; they're listed here
only so you recognize them, not so you memorize them:

- **Formatting & indentation**: 4-space indent, LF line endings, final newline, no trailing
  whitespace (`.editorconfig`, ktlint, spotless).
- **Line length**: keep lines **≤ 120 chars** — detekt's `MaxLineLength`
  (`config/detekt/detekt.yml`) fails the build past 120. (Note: `.editorconfig`'s ktlint
  `max_line_length` is 180, so detekt is the binding constraint; the IDE shows visual guides at
  80/120/180.)
- **No wildcard imports** (e.g. `import java.util.*`) — they pollute the namespace and break when
  the wildcard package gains a colliding class.
- **Expression bodies** for single-expression functions (`fun add(augend: Int, addend: Int) = augend + addend`).
- **Trailing commas** in multi-line parameter/argument lists (cleaner diffs).
- **License header**: every `.kt` file must start with the Apache header from
  `spotless/copyright.kt` (`spotlessApply` adds it; diktat and detekt verify it too).
- **Every diktat and detekt rule is on**, in `src/main` and `src/test`. The ones new code trips
  most often:
  - KDoc on every public/internal class and function, with `@param`/`@return`/`@throws` tags.
  - Identifiers of at least 2 characters, including lambda parameters (`cause ->`, not `e ->`).
  - No `print`/`println`: use a logger, or add a narrow `@Suppress("DEBUG_PRINT", "ForbiddenMethodCall")`
    where stdout *is* the output (see `main` in `Application.kt`).
  - A file-level KDoc between the license header and `package` in files that don't contain
    exactly one class.
  - `lateinit` properties after the regular ones.

  If a rule really doesn't fit, suppress it narrowly with a reason; don't switch it off in the
  config.
- **Detekt baseline**: pre-existing issues are parked in `config/detekt/detekt-baseline.xml`; don't
  add to it for new code.

## Naming

- Packages: lowercase, no underscores (`dev.shtanko.template`).
- Classes / objects: `PascalCase` (`DataProcessor`).
- Functions / properties: `camelCase` (`processDataStream`, `ioDispatcher`).
- Constants (`const val`, or deeply-immutable `val` with no custom getter): `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  (`MAX_COUNT`).
- Backing properties: leading underscore (`private val _items`).
- Test functions: backticked, descriptive sentences are encouraged here
  (`` fun `divide by zero throws`() ``). This is a JVM backend, so the Android restriction on
  spaces-in-backticks does not apply. Backticks are for `@Test` functions only; diktat rejects them
  on `@ParameterizedTest`/`@TestFactory` functions, which take lowerCamelCase names instead.

## Conventions that need judgment

### Immutability & null-safety
- **Prefer `val` over `var`.** Only reach for `var` when reassignment is genuinely required.
- **Never use `!!`.** Use safe calls `?.`, the Elvis operator `?:`, or restructure so nullability
  is handled explicitly. `!!` is the most common source of avoidable `NullPointerException`.
- **Specify nullability at Java boundaries.** Don't let platform types (`String!`) leak untyped
  into Kotlin code.

### Control flow as expressions
- Use `if`, `when`, and `try`/`catch` as **expressions** that produce a value, rather than
  statements that mutate a `var` (see `Calculator.divide`).
- Prefer `when` over deeply nested `if`/`else` chains. Keep code flat with early returns.
- For the full branching procedure — subject selection, guard conditions, exhaustiveness, smart
  casts — load [`kotlin-control-flow`](../skills/kotlin-control-flow/SKILL.md).

### Scope functions
- `let` — null checks / operating on a non-null value: `user?.let { render(it) }`.
- `apply` — configure an object and return it.
- `also` — side effects (logging) that return the receiver.
- `run` / `with` — grouping calls on a receiver and returning a result.
- Don't nest scope functions deeply, and don't use `let` to replace a plain `if`.

### Modeling data & state
- **`data class` for models** — free `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString`/`copy`.
- **`sealed class` / `sealed interface` for closed hierarchies** (e.g. a `Result`/`State` with
  `Loading`/`Success`/`Error`) so `when` can be exhaustive without an `else`.
- `enum class` only when the variants carry no distinct data.
- For choosing `@JvmInline value class` vs `data class`, load
  [`kotlin-types-value-class`](../skills/kotlin-types-value-class/SKILL.md).

### Collections & performance
- Use idiomatic operators (`filterNotNull()`, `map`, `forEach`) over manual index loops.
- Prefer `asSequence()` for large collections with several chained transformations to avoid
  intermediate allocations.
- `inline` higher-order functions to avoid lambda allocation overhead; use `reified` when you need
  the type at runtime.
- `by lazy { … }` for expensive objects that may not be needed.
- Avoid allocating in tight loops.

### Function ownership
- Put a function on its smallest accurate semantic owner: a project type's member, a stateless
  top-level function, a named factory, or an injected collaborator when it retains policy, state,
  I/O, or dependencies.
- Be skeptical of extensions on `String`, primitives, collections, `Flow`, or third-party types —
  they usually create false ownership. Load
  [`kotlin-functions`](../skills/kotlin-functions/SKILL.md) for the full decision procedure.

### Modifiers & annotations
- Follow the standard Kotlin modifier order: `public`/`protected`/`private`/`internal` →
  `expect`/`actual` → `final`/`open`/`abstract`/`sealed`/`const` →
  `external`/`override`/`lateinit`/`tailrec` → `vararg`/`suspend`/`inner` →
  `enum`/`annotation`/`fun` → `companion` → `inline`/`value`/`infix`/`operator` → `data`.
- Put annotations on their own line before the declaration (multiple parameterless annotations may
  share a line).
- Never write `: Unit` explicitly; omit the return type for `Unit` functions.

## Coroutines

The canonical example is **`DataProcessor.kt`** — read it first. Key rules:

- **Inject dispatchers; never hardcode them.** Pass a `CoroutineDispatcher` via the constructor so
  tests can substitute a test dispatcher.

  ```kotlin
  // ✅ inject the dispatcher
  class NewsRepository(
      private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher = Dispatchers.IO,
  ) {
      suspend fun loadNews() = withContext(ioDispatcher) { /* ... */ }
  }

  // ❌ hardcoded — untestable
  class NewsRepository {
      suspend fun loadNews() = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { /* ... */ }
  }
  ```

- **Keep `suspend` functions main-safe.** A `suspend` function should be safe to call from any
  thread; if it does heavy work or I/O, shift context internally with `withContext(ioDispatcher)`
  (as `DataProcessor.fetchIds` does).
- **Use structured concurrency.** Launch child coroutines inside `coroutineScope`/
  `supervisorScope` so they all complete before the parent returns. Return values via
  `async`/`await` instead of mutating shared `var`s.
- **Avoid `GlobalScope`** and never store an unowned `CoroutineScope` on a class. **Cancel scopes,
  not `Job`s.**
- **Check for cancellation** in long CPU-bound loops with `ensureActive()` or `yield()`.
- **Exception handling**: prefer `try`/`catch` around the specific suspend calls you can recover
  from; never swallow `CancellationException` without rethrowing. For `Flow`, handle errors with
  the `catch` operator (see `DataProcessor.processDataStream`).

For the full anti-pattern review procedure — stored scopes, `init`-block launches,
`runBlocking`, cancellation swallowing — load
[`kotlin-coroutines-structured-concurrency`](../skills/kotlin-coroutines-structured-concurrency/SKILL.md).
For `StateFlow`/`SharedFlow`/`Channel` primitive selection, load
[`kotlin-flow-state-event-modeling`](../skills/kotlin-flow-state-event-modeling/SKILL.md).

## Quick reference: ❌ avoid → ✅ prefer

| Topic | ❌ Avoid | ✅ Prefer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Null check | `if (user != null) user.name` | `user?.name ?: "Unknown"` |
| Mutability | `var count = 0` (never reassigned) | `val count = 0` |
| Looping | `for (i in 0..list.size - 1)` | `list.forEach { … }` / `for (x in list)` |
| Strings | `"Hello " + name + "!"` | `"Hello $name!"` |
| Function body | `fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int { return a + b }` | `fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b` |
| State modeling | `open class State` holding data | `sealed interface State` |
| Object config | `val p = Point(); p.x = 1` | `Point().apply { x = 1 }` |
| Constants | `val maxCount = 10` (top level) | `const val MAX_COUNT = 10` |
| Filtering nulls | `list.filter { it != null }.map { it!! }` | `list.filterNotNull()` |
| Branching | `if (a==1) x else if (a==2) y else z` | `when (a) { 1 -> x; 2 -> y; else -> z }` |
| Dispatcher | `withContext(Dispatchers.IO) { … }` | `withContext(injectedDispatcher) { … }` |
| Coroutine scope | `GlobalScope.launch { … }` | An owned, structured scope |

## SOLID

- **SRP** — one reason to change; keep classes/functions small and focused.
- **OCP** — extend behavior via interfaces/abstractions instead of editing existing classes.
- **LSP** — subtypes must be substitutable; don't override just to throw `NotImplementedError`.
- **ISP** — prefer several small, client-specific interfaces over one fat interface.
- **DIP** — depend on abstractions; inject dependencies through the constructor rather than
  instantiating them inside (mirrors the dispatcher-injection rule above).
